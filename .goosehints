- always compile the project after you're done to make sure that everything still works.
- reuse as much code as you can, avoid code duplication. 
- if files get too long (longer than 300ish lines) tend to create new files when you write code with a new responsibility. we want to keep the files relatively short and keep the code easier to maintain.
- design all features so that it looks incredibly good, Apple-like high quality app design with great UX and professional and useful design that makes it easy to use as a person working at a checkout. Apple-like UI design patterns.
