# Shellshock 🥜⚡

Shellshock is an Android Point-of-Sale application that enables merchants to receive Cashu ecash payments via smartcards. Using NFC technology, it provides a simple way to process transactions with physical cards that store ecash.

> [!WARNING]
> This application is **NOT** a wallet. It only acts as a terminal to receive payments and immediately generate redemption tokens. It does not store any tokens. tokens **MUST** be redeemed in a proper Cashu wallet after receiving them, or the funds will be lost.

## Overview

The application acts as a simple point-of-sale terminal for Cashu smartcards. When a customer presents their card, the app receives the ecash payment and immediately generates a token that the merchant must redeem in their Cashu wallet. The app does not store or manage any funds - it only facilitates the immediate transfer from card to token.

## How It Works

Using Shellshock is straightforward:

The merchant enters the desired amount in satoshis using the application's keypad. When a customer presents their Cashu smartcard to the merchant's NFC-enabled Android device, Shellshock communicates with the card to process the payment.

If the card is PIN-protected, the customer enters their PIN through a secure input dialog. Once verified, the application checks the card's balance and receives the payment. A Cashu token is immediately generated and displayed, which the merchant must copy and redeem in their actual Cashu wallet right away.

The app also includes a balance checking feature to verify a card's available funds, and a top-up function that allows loading Cashu tokens onto cards.

Additionally, Shellshock now simulates a Type 4 Forum tag with a payment request that can be read from or written to using NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format). This makes the application compatible with web applications like cashu.me that utilize the WebNFC API for NFC interactions. This feature enables seamless communication between web-based Cashu applications and the Shellshock terminal.

## Features

- Simple amount entry with numeric keypad
- Secure NFC communication with Cashu smartcards
- PIN verification for protected cards
- Balance checking functionality
- Card top-up capability
- Immediate token display and copy functionality
- Type 4 Forum tag simulation with NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) compatibility
- Compatibility with web applications like cashu.me through WebNFC API
- [Coming Soon] Direct "Open With" integration for Cashu wallets

## Requirements

- Android device with NFC capability
- Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
- Compatible Cashu smartcard
- Android Studio or Gradle for building

## Building

To build the debug version of the app:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shellshock2.git
cd shellshock2

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# The APK will be available at:
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Alternatively, you can open the project in Android Studio and build it using the IDE's build tools.

## Smartcard Compatibility

Shellshock interfaces with the [Satocash-Applet](https://github.com/Toporin/Satocash-Applet), a JavaCard applet implementation that enables secure storage and transfer of Cashu tokens on smartcards. The applet must be installed on a compatible JavaCard for the app to function properly. For more information about the smartcard implementation and compatibility, please refer to the Satocash-Applet repository.

## NDEF Compatibility

Shellshock now simulates a Type 4 Forum tag with payment requests encoded using NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format). This feature enables:

- Reading/writing NDEF messages from web applications that use the WebNFC API
- Direct compatibility with web-based Cashu applications like cashu.me
- Seamless integration between physical NFC devices and web-based payment systems
- Cross-platform payment processing without requiring specialized hardware

The NDEF implementation follows the NFC Forum specifications, ensuring broad compatibility with various NFC-enabled applications and devices.

## Getting Started

After building Shellshock, simply install the APK on your device and open the app. You'll be presented with the amount entry screen. No additional setup is required - the app is ready to process payments immediately.
